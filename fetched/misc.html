            <h4 class="font-bold">IDEs : </h4>
        
            <p>
                An <span class="font-bold">Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</span> is a comprehensive software application that provides programmers with a suite of tools to write, 
                test, and debug their code more efficiently. It combines several aspects of software development into one interface, including a source code 
                editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
                </br>
                I regularly use <span class="font-bold">Visual Studio</span> for the majority of my projects, taking full advantage of its integrated debugger to efficiently track down and 
                fix bugs, enhancing the quality and reliability of my code. Visual Studio's robust environment supports my development workflow, making it a 
                key tool in my programming arsenal.
                </br>
                For my <span class="font-bold">Java-based projects, I turn to IntelliJ IDEA.</span> This IDE is particularly beneficial due to its 
                <span class="font-bold">integration with Gradle,</span> a powerful build automation system. Gradle streamlines the build process, manages dependencies, 
                and automates tasks, making IntelliJ an invaluable resource for efficient and effective Java development.

            <h4 class="font-bold">R language : </h4>

            <p>
                R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for <span class="font-bold">statistical computing and graphics.</span> It is widely used among statisticians 
                and data analysts for data mining, statistical analysis, and graphical representation of data. R is known for its extensive library of packages, 
                offering a vast array of <span class="font-bold">statistical techniques</span> such as linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others. 
                It also excels in producing high-quality plots and graphs, which are essential for <span class="font-bold">data visualization and interpretation.</span>
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold">QGIS : </h4>
            
            <p>
                QGIS is an open-source <span class="font-bold">Geographic Information System (GIS) software</span>, widely acclaimed for its ability to analyze, edit, and 
                visualize geospatial information. It is a versatile tool for mapping and spatial data analysis, supporting various data formats 
                and offering an intuitive interface. My practical involvement with QGIS includes the development of a bespoke plugin designed to 
                serve the specific needs of municipal workers in Strasbourg. This plugin enabled field agents to perform their site surveys using a tablet, 
                allowing them to report and centralize all information directly onto a map.
