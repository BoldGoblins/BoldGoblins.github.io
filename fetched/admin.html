                In the field of networking, I am adept at <span class="font-bold">configuring interfaces</span> for NAT (Network Address Translation) or Bridge connections, essential for 
                managing and optimizing network traffic. My proficiency extends to setting up <span class="font-bold">firewalls (with Iptables or Fail2Ban)</span>, a crucial aspect of network security, ensuring the protection and 
                integrity of network systems. Additionally, I am knowledgeable in <span class="font-bold">file transfer protocols (SMB/FTP)</span>, which is fundamental for the efficient and secure 
                exchange of data across networks.
            </p>
